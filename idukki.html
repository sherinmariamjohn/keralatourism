                  <h2>Idukki (ഇടുക്കി), IPA: [iɖukːi], is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala.[5][6] Idukki district lies amid the Cardamom Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala. Idukki district contains two municipal towns - Kattappana and Thodupuzha. The district currently includes five taluks in it. The district was constituted on 26 January 1972, by taking Peerumade, Udumbanchola, Devikulam taluks of the former High Range division from Kottayam district and the Thodupuzha taluk from Ernakulam district.[7] Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Malayalam and English are the two official administrative languages in the district.[3] Around 66% of Kerala's power needs come from various Hydroelectric Power Projects in Idukki district.[1] Numerous cash crops and spices are cultivated throughout the district, making it The Spice Garden of Kerala.[1] A significant area in the district is protected as reserved forests and wildlife sanctuaries.[1] The Periyar River is a major river that originates and flows through Idukki. The Pamba River is another important river that originates from Idukki district. Though it is the second-largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala. There are only two municipalities in the district and the urban population is comparatively much lower than the rural population, due to its mountainous nature. The 2,695 metres (8,842 ft) high peak of Anamudi, which is also the highest point of elevation in India outside the Himalayas, lies in the northern portion of the district of Idukki.[8] The Idukki Dam is one of the highest arch dams in Asia.[9]</h2>
